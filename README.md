# Conjugu
Just a simple Next.js + Supabase application I made to learn Sapnish conjugation. This project was to learn Supabase, so do not expect future updates.

## Expected fixes / features:
- Fix lower/uppercase matching for answers. ✅
- Fix card answers having stuff like 's/he' and instead matching to both 'she' and 'he'. ✅
- Fix KBM flow with submitting cards (remove need to press TAB to select next card).
- Add more decks
- Add 'lesson decks' (no spaced repetition, just explaining some theory).
- Add chapters for decks.
- Add a 'practice mode', to practice all scheduled cards. ✅
- Add a page with a learned words overview, and the stability of those words.
- Clean up / refactor code (current code is more prototype-y).
